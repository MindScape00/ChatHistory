# ChatHistory
Chat History (Persistent Chat)

This addon keeps a local history of your chat and then restores it every time you login, so you don't miss out on the last thing said, and don't have to fumble thru another addon menu to find it.Â It will store the last 500 messages received. The report is printed upon login, so you can scroll up and see what you missed, or what was said.

## Installation
Drag the "ChatHistory" folder to your Epsilon/\_retail_/Interface/Addons/ folder. Launch the game, and login. In bottom left of Character Select, click "Addons" and then ensure Chat History is enabled. There is no config or commands, it runs automatically.

## Credits
This addon is originally created by Vladinator from WoW Interface and all credits go to them for the original addon; this is merely a fork to update it to 8.3 and gear it towards Epsilon players.
